# Let‚Äôs Build an App with React (Devreach 2019 Workshop)

This readme.md will serve as your guide to putting our instruction into practice. Each commit to this repository will add new instructions to this `readme.md` file. Each commit corresponds with a portion of the workshop that you will build.

Every portion of this workshop is started and indicated in this document by a level 2 heading. A new lesson and instruction for each phase of the workshop is added with each commit to this repository. We will start with ‚ÄúHello React‚Äù below.

## ‚ÄúHello React‚Äù with Webpack & Babel

Welcome to the 2019 DevReach: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Build an App With React‚Äù workshop. We'll get started building our React toolchain.

### Create Project Folders and Initialize npm

```bash
mkdir space-x-app
```

```bash
cd space-x-app
```

```bash
npm init
```

```bash
mkdir app
```

```bash
code .
```

We now have a `package.json` and `app` directory, let's also create the following files in the root directory:

- `.gitignore`
- `webpack.config.babel.js`

And inside the `app` directory create the following files:

- `index.js`
- `index.html`
- `App.js`
- `App.scss`

### Dev Dependencies for React

I created three separate commands for installing our dev-dependencies grouped by which ones are related. Let's install each all of them!

`npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin`

`npm i --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react`

`npm i --save-dev babel-loader node-sass file-loader sass-loader style-loader css-loader url-loader`

### Create Build/Start Scripts to Run Webpack & Dev-server

We need to add a `build` and `start` command in our `package.json`'s scripts right next to the existing test script:

```json
    "test": "echo \"No test script\"",
    "build": "webpack",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --open"
```

### Add Babel & Presets to `package.json`

Article about `preset-env`:[What is babel-preset-env and why do I need it?](https://blog.jakoblind.no/babel-preset-env/). K

now that each plugin is its own npm library and this one allows transpiling ES6 to legacy JS code. [`preset-react`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) is just a bundle of other libraries:

- `@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx`
- `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`
- `@babel/plugin-transform-react-display-name`

`preset-react` allows us to use JSX in conjunction with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [React]([https://reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)).

Even in our most simple ‚ÄúHello React‚Äù exanmple, we will need JSX, so let's add the following code to our `package.json` just above our scripts:

```json
"babel": {
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    "@babel/preset-react"
  ]
},
```

### Production Dependencies for ‚ÄúHello React‚Äù

Articles on Normalize(`normalize.css`):

- [About Normalize CSS](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/)
- [Normalize CSS or CSS Reset?](https://medium.com/@elad/normalize-css-or-css-reset-9d75175c5d1e)

Normalize is a modern CSS reset for cross-browser consistency considering the styling of HTML elements.

```bash
npm i --save react react-dom react-router-dom normalize.css
```

### Bootstrap Our App and Create Our First Component

Below we walk through the steps to bootstrap our `Index.html` file and get our React app working with our initial `App` component.

#### Index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
<head>
  <title>SpaceX Events Home</title>
  <link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:200,300,400" rel="stylesheet">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <meta name="Description" content="Author: Your Name">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### `index.Js` (JS Entrypoint/Bootstrapper)

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

#### `App.js` (Initial Component)

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import 'normalize.css';
import './App.scss';

const App = () => <h1>Hello React</h1>;

export default App;
```

#### App.scss (Ensure Transpiling to Css Works)

An Article on Sass: [Why Sass](https://alistapart.com/article/why-sass/)

Why Sass(SCSS) over CSS? This is something we utilize in our project and without Sass we would not be able to easily create our light and dark theme (later on). If you would like to learn more about Sass/SCSS, [check out this article](https://alistapart.com/article/why-sass/).

```scss
body {
  background-color: #222;
}
h1 {
  padding: 0 0 0 1em;
  color: #61dafb;
  font-family: Lato;
}
```

#### `.Gitignore` (Assets Not Tracked by Git)

For more information on creating a `.gitignore` file and why we need them, see [this article ](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files) for more info.

```

#### `webpack.config.babel.js`

```
var path = require("path");
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./app/index.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "index_bundle.js",
    publicPath: "/"
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js)$/,
        use: "babel-loader"
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        loaders: ["style-loader", "css-loader"]
      },
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [
          "style-loader", // creates style nodes from JS strings
          "css-loader", // translates CSS into CommonJS
          "sass-loader" // compiles Sass to CSS, using Node Sass by default
        ]
      },
      {
        test: /\.(jpe?g|png|gif|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|svg)(\?[a-z0-9=.]+)?$/,
        loader: "url-loader?limit=100000"
      }
    ]
  },
  mode: "development",
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".js", ".jsx"]
  },
  devServer: {
    historyApiFallback: true
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "app/index.html"
    })
  ]
};
```

With these files in place, run the project for the first time.

```bash
npm run start
```

### Init, Stage and Commit Our Files

You should get a page running on `http://localhost:8080` with a dark background and‚ÄúHello React‚Äù heading with no errors. This indicates that all of our configuration and styles are working and React is rendering an application for us!

Let's stop here and save our changes.

#### Initialize Our Git Repository in Place

From the root of our project, initialize git:

```bash
git init
```

We should notice our `.gitignore` working and hiding not tracking our `npm_modules` directory üòâ!

#### Create an Empty Repository on Github

We need an empty repository on GitHub to push this project and its first commit to. Next, we will stage, commit and push to our origin's master:

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "Hello React (Webpack, Babel and React)"
```

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/httpJunkie/2019-devreach-react-workshop.git
```

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### That's it for our ‚ÄúHello React‚Äù portion of the workshop

We created our own [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) & [React]([https://reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)) build ourselves, without using something like Create React App ([CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) to and because of this we are smarter about our application and have a better understanding of how a minimal React application works under the hood and how to build and run that application from a basic standpoint.

We will tackle linting in the next section.

## Getting Started with ESLint

Article on ESLint: [Getting Started](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

We need to install and initialize ESLint.

```bash
npm i --save-dev eslint babel-eslint eslint-watch eslint-plugin-react
```

## Add Linting for ES6, JSX and React Hooks

Create our ESLint configuration file in the root directory of our project:

#### `.eslintrc` (ESLint Config)

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "react"
  ],
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 6,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "es6": true,
    "browser": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "extends": [],
  "rules": {
    "semi": ["error", "always"],
    "quotes": ["error", "double"]
  },
  "settings": {
    "react": {
      "version": "16.9"
    }
  }
}
```

Before we can run our linter, let's add a `lint` and `lint:fix` script to our `package.json` just above the test script:

```json
    "lint": "eslint app --ext .js,.jsx",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --fix app --ext .js,.jsx",
```

Again, they are made to work specifically with React hence the `.js` and `.jsx` file extensions. Now let's run our linter.

```bash
npm run lint
```

Right away we get some errors:

```bash
‚úñ 6 problems (6 errors, 0 warnings)
  6 errors and 0 warnings potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

This is great, it means our linter is working. But as a team, let's assume that we do not want to follow the double quote rule and we only want to follow the semi-colon rule. Let's make the following changes to the `.eslintrc` file:

```json
    "semi": ["warn", "always"],
    "quotes": ["off", "double"]
```

At this point we should not get any errors.  We can turn off the quotes as shown above, or completely remove it. If you would like to test the linter one more time, try removing some semi-colons and running it again.

### Adding linting for React Hooks

Some rules that we may want to apply are not built into ESLint because they are framework specific and we are working in React. If we want to apply the suggested rules for using Hooks in React, we need to add a new package that can be used as a plugin, we already have one plugin added and set up for JSX, but let's show how to add another one.

Let's install the package we need:

```bash
npm i --save-dev eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

First we will add `react-hooks` to the plugin section the `.eslintrc` file:

```json
    "react",
    "react-hooks"
```

then, we will add the rule to the rules section the `.eslintrc` file:

```json
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn",
    "semi": ["warn", "always"],
    "quotes": ["off", "double"]
```

To check the plugin is working, replace the first line in `App.js` with:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("This should trigger our Hooks rule");
});
```

Run our linter again and you should get a warning, appended to the end is the rule responsible for this error `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`:

```bash
C:\dev\workshops\2019-devreach-react-workshop\app\App.js
  2:1  error  React Hook "useEffect" cannot be called at the top level. React Hooks must be called in a React function component or a custom React Hook function  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
```

Discard our changes in `App.js` Our Hooks linting is working.

Let's use a rule that will work with our `react` plugin!
In the [JSX-specific-rules section of their documentation]((https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react#jsx-specific-rules)) we can see a rule for no duplicate props.

Add the following to the `.eslintrc` file's rule's section:

```json
    "react/jsx-no-duplicate-props": "error",
```

We could then go into our `index.js` file and add duplicate props:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<App isTrue={true} isTrue={false} />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

And we get the following error:

```bash
C:\dev\workshops\2019-devreach-react-workshop\app\index.js
  6:36  error  No duplicate props allowed  react/jsx-no-duplicate-props
```

Again, the rule that triggered this error is listed at the end of the error.

This next change will probably have no effect, but let's update the React version in our `.eslintrc` file, ensure that it matches the version of React you have installed:

```json
 "settings": {
    "react": {
      "version": "16.10"
    }
  }
```

Great, linting is working and I can leave exploring new rules up to you! This concludes the linting section of the workshop. Next up is some prep work needed to create a responsive frame for our application.
